### Available Databases

All sequences were obtained from GenBank, and databases created using makeblastdb. For each category, only homologous target genes were included, i.e., gene clusters or genomes were excluded; to include complete (though non-targeted) hits, the obtained results (*align_query_seq*, from the ISeqDb output) should be blasted in NCBI.

*mcyB* (Cyanobacteria) [204-2888 bp]; 772 sequences

*mcyD* (Cyanobacteria) [195-1964 bp]; 154 sequences

*mcyE* (Cyanobacteria) [209-1697 bp]; 964 sequences

*anaC* (Cyanobacteria) [255-897 bp]; 140 sequences

*anaF* (Cyanobacteria) [186-462 bp]; 38 sequences

*geosmin synthase gene (geoA)* (Cyanobacteria) [421-1596]; 318 sequences

*rbcL* (diatoms) [255-3476 bp]; 5929 sequences

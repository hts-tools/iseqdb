### Available Databases

All sequences were obtained from GenBank, and databases created using makeblastdb. For each category, only homologous target genes were included, i.e., gene clusters or genomes were excluded; to include complete (though non-targeted) hits, the obtained results (*align_query_seq*, from the ISeqDb output) should be blasted in NCBI.
